# bed2013_3dvis

Elevation data from the Bed2013 elevation product with 3D visualisation

Need to add more to this...

## Things to note

webgl doesn't work on phone browsers....

## Other things to try:

[   ] remove no data values from the array 

[   ] set axis limits

[   ] add inset map

[   ] remove zoom buttons (or at least place them specifically)

[   ] centre the colorbar zero (i.e. for diverging, have 0 as white)
